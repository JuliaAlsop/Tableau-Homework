The most important day of any year....your birthday! Who doesnt like to find out what their horoscope year says about them, or how their birth year holds value? By looking at birth years in our data analysis we can really take a closer look at the different ages of bikers and better understand the rider. 

By using a bubble map the majority of bikers can be seen as having been born after the 1980's in the age group of 40's and younger. We can also see that the majority of riders, apx. 3922, were born in 1990 and are around 30 years old. In the third and final graph concerning age, one can see a slight increase in the trip duration of bikers that were born after the 1980's.


The most basic analysis of humans breaks down to gender, male vs. female vs. other. Knowing which gender is more attracted or has more use for a product can offer a wide variety of how advertisements can be laid out to better target the most clientel. 

In the second dashboard a completed analysis of gender for the October 2020 citibike data can be viewed. By using a gantt graph one can see how female (gender 2) have longer trip durations overall versus other genders. Although males (gender 1) and other (gender 0) have data points with longer duration, females show a continuous overall trip duration. 

The second dashboard also houses a street view map of all the end station locations and an overlay map of gender compared areas. By reviewing the map one can see that a large amount of stations are located in areas that are highly equal in gender with a ratio of 1.012 to 1.11 viewable in light green.
